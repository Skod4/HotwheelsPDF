## Installation Guide

### Windows Users

2. Download the latest `HotwheelsPDF-Windows.exe`
3. Double-click the downloaded file to run the application

Note: When running for the first time, Windows might show a SmartScreen warning. This happens because the app is new and not yet widely distributed. To run anyway:
1. Click "More info"
2. Click "Run anyway"
3. You only need to do this once

### Mac Users
1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/Skod4/HotwheelsPDF/releases) page
2. Download the latest `HotwheelsPDF-Mac.dmg`
3. Double-click the downloaded DMG file
4. **Important**: Drag HotwheelsPDF to your Applications folder
   - Don't run the app directly from the DMG
   - Running from Applications ensures proper permissions

#### First Time Setup on macOS
When launching for the first time, you'll need to bypass macOS security measures:

1. **If you see "app cannot be opened because it is from an unidentified developer":**
   - Right-click (or Control-click) HotwheelsPDF in Applications
   - Select "Open" from the menu
   - Click "Open" in the security dialog
   - This step is only needed once

2. **If the app is blocked in Security & Privacy:**
   - Open System Preferences > Security & Privacy
   - Click the lock icon to make changes (you'll need your password)
   - Look for "HotwheelsPDF was blocked from use"
   - Click "Open Anyway"
   - Follow the steps above to open the app

After completing these steps once, you can open HotwheelsPDF normally by double-clicking.

#### Troubleshooting on macOS
If you're having issues:
1. Make sure you're running the app from Applications folder
2. Check System Preferences > Security & Privacy for any blocked permissions
3. If the app won't open at all:
   - Open Terminal
   - Type: `xattr -cr /Applications/HotwheelsPDF.app`
   - Try opening the app again
